# Data Story: Focusing on Cybersecurity for Seniors with CyberGuardian.io
The inception of CyberGuardian.io was rooted in an alarming reality: the growing vulnerability of Australian seniors to cyber scams and frauds. This demographic's limited familiarity with advanced technology and the exponential increase in scams targeting them catalysed the development of CyberGuardian.io. Here, we present an overview of the data sources that justified this focus and provided insights into tailoring the solution for the unique needs of Australian seniors.

## Cyber.gov.au - Reports and Statistics
Description of Use: This platform provided an understanding of the general cybersecurity landscape in Australia. Delving into the specific trends and statistics related to seniors exposed a substantial gap in their cybersecurity awareness and protection.

## ACSC Annual Cyber Threat Report, July 2021 to June 2022
Description of Use: This report served as a rich source of insights into the rising threats against seniors.

### Key Insights and Applications:
- Identification of Senior-Specific Threats: The report contained detailed analyses of cyber threats, including those explicitly targeting seniors, such as phishing, investment scams, and identity theft.
- Development of Predictive Models: By recognising patterns in these senior-specific attacks, machine learning models were created to predict and respond to similar threats in the future.
- Security Hardening Tailored to Seniors: The insights enabled the development of automated tools, precisely designed to counter the types of threats that seniors are most susceptible to.

Summary: The ACSC threat report helped zero in on the unique cybersecurity challenges facing seniors, guiding the creation of specific defences in CyberGuardian.io.

## Detecting and Responding to Cyber Security Incidents
Description of Use: This dataset provided granular information on different cybersecurity incidents, with a focus on attacks affecting seniors.

### Key Insights and Applications:
- Training Machine Learning Models for Senior-Specific Threats: Utilising data that revealed common threats against seniors, models were developed to recognise and block these attacks in real-time.
- Automated Response for Seniors: Leveraging past incidents, automated response plans were tailored for seniors, enabling rapid containment of detected attacks and minimal damage.
## Conclusion
The creation of CyberGuardian.io was motivated by compelling evidence that Australian seniors were increasingly at risk from cyber threats and had unique protection requirements. By meticulously analysing data sources and focusing on the distinct trends, patterns, and vulnerabilities affecting this demographic, CyberGuardian.io was carefully crafted to offer targeted, intelligent defences for seniors. The solution not only empowers seniors against the modern, complex world of cyber threats but also provides their families and carers the assurance of safety in the digital age. This concentrated effort exemplifies how data-driven insights can lead to the development of a solution that addresses the particular needs of a vulnerable community.
